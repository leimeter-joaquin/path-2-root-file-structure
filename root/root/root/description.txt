The livingroom

It is a spacious, yet imposing space. A large shelf lined with dusty, old books takes up one entire wall. The air feels heavy and thick, almost suffocating, it has a slightly sour odor, as if it hasn't been aired out for a long time. 

In the center of the room, two plush sofas sit facing each other, their dark colors contrasting against the dark-green heavy carpet underneath. A small, low table rests between the sofas, on it's surface there is a upside down cup with red stains and lamp.

The only sources of illumination are the lamp on the table and the moon casting shadows through the closed curtains, giving the room an unsettling feel.

You see an opening to what appears to be the kitchen and another one to a hallway.
