Bathroom:

The door only opens by putting all your weight into it and pushing, the floor is just covered in dried up blood and dirt, walking in it is as sticky as walking on sement. To your left there the sink and the shower, both just as dirty as they can get. One breath tells you that is not a good idea to stay in here for long or you will puke your guts out.

Above the sink you see a broken mirror, one hole in it tells you that there's a cabinet behind it, but you have to be carefull to open it without cutting yourself.

You turn around and see the toilet, there is not enough courage in you to look into it, just a quick glance at how dirty it is is enough to remove that idea from your mind.
