The body lying on the sacrifice table is a terrible sight. 

It's blackened and charred, its skin blistered and peeled. Despite the obvious signs of death, the eyes of the body remain open, fixed in a wide stare. The eyes seem to be trying to communicate something, to convey a final message to the living, but it's as if something took away its voice. The body's frozen expression is one of anguish and desperation, as if it's begging for help even in its final moments. 

The sight is a reminder of the fragility of life, and the inevitability of death.

After a few seconds of staring at the body's eyes, you see that a key is embedded in the skin of the chest.
