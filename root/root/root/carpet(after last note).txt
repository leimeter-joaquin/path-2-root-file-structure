Carpet:

You stand for a while looking at the green carpet second guessing if it is a good idea to
move it at all, after overthiking you decide to get this over with and move it.

First you move the couches to make it easier, then you start dragging this
carpet by pulling while walking back a little, you get a first glance at what it seems
to be the only clean part of the floor in the entirety of the house.

There you see it, an old rusty trapdoor. You think that this may be the reason for all the
squeaking when you were walking and also the next step to get out of her with the truth.
