Welome to Path 2 Root. 

You are an investigator tasked with solving the disappearance of a young woman that lives alone in her home.
 
She is a 34-year-old woman, Janine Kotlin. She leads a solitary life, with no pets, family, partner, or children to keep her company. She often keeps to herself, feeling isolated and alone in the world.

Her dissapearence was reported 2 days ago by her neighbors, they noticed that for past few weeks the trash was not longer being taken out, the blind were closed all the time, they wouldn't see her outside taking care of the garden and most importantly, she wouldn't answer the door.

The police managed to enter the home but were immediately repelled by the unsettling atmosphere. It is your job to get to the ROOT of this.
