Mirror Cabinet:

You try not to think with kind of awfull surprises you may find inside this cabinet, you open it since you
can't handle the smell any longer.

There you see it, a folded paper with what it seems to be blood stains with the shape of fingerprints
Is this the woman's blood or something else has happened here?. You take the paper and unfolded

The note says: "Under the cup and below the green layer you will find me or what was me, I'm not longer
here but for those who may want to find me. I'm waiting..."
