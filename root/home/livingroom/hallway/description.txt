Hallway:

Walking into the hallway of the house you notice how the natural light
from outside isn't able to reach here, you feel as if the more you walk
the space gets smaller and smaller.
The moist stains on the wall gives you the certainty that the house wasn't taken care of
even before the report of the missing woman.

Ahead of you at the end of this hallway you see two doors, one right
in front of you and the other to your left, both seem to be made of
old worn out wood with scratches all over them, like some sort of fight
happened here.

You wonder whats on the other side of this doors but you focus on one
in front of you.
