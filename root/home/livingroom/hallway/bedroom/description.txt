The bedroom:

The bedroom has 4 interesting things: a bed, a bedsidetable, a wardrove and a huge window that lets in very little light for its size, probably because of the thick and dirty glass.

The smell here is much cleaner than that of the living room, thankfully the window has a small opening.

  triggerSound('wooshing sound from window')
  prompt('At the corner of the your eye you see a shadow passing through the window.')
}
