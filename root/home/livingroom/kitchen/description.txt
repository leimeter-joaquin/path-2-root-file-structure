The kitchen:

The countertops are cluttered with empty cans and packages, long forgotten. Cobwebs line the corners of the room, and a thin layer of grime covers the once-shiny appliances. The cabinets are half open and worn down.

The sink is filled with dirty dishes, and a musty smell lingers in the air. The moonlight filters through the dirty windows, casting eerie shadows on the floor. 
The room feels as though time has stood still, and the kitchen is now a ghost of its former self.
