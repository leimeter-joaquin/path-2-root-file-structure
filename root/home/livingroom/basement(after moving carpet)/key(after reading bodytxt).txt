(the basement door shuts and locks sound)

The moment you touched the key the basement door shut closed, on a panic you look around you, covering your back, trying to flee away from that feeling of vulnerability on the back of your neck.

All that is left is to get the key from the body.

Your hands start shaking as you aproach the skin, it is not easy but you manage to get the key.
