The basement is a dank and putrid place, filled with the stench of decay and rot. The only light comes from a flickering torch, casting shadows across the rough stone walls and cobweb-strewn ceiling. In the dim glow of the flame, a massive, hulking shape can be seen in the center of the room - a sort of sacrifice table.

On the table, a human shape, burnt and crippled seems to be breathing.

The overall scene is one of horror.
