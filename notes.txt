1. You enter the living room and inspect in there
you can access kitchet, hallway -> bedroom. no access to bathroom.

2. in the bedroom you find a key. you can now access the bathroom.

3. in the bathrom you see a message/note/something that tells you there is a basement.
You get access to the move command, the only thing that can be moved is the carpet.

4. after this when you go back to the living room the music changes a bit. and yo see the carpet.txt file.
here you should use the move carpet command to gain access to the basement.

5. you cd into the basement. a locking sound happens, you cannot go back into the living room. the basement has some weird writing on the walls and a body with a foul smell, it's the woman. On one of her clawed up hands you see a key.

6. You get the key and open the basement door again. you gain access to the cd .. command that lets you exit the house and win the game?

7. The living room now has a new file. figure.txt
Openingthe figure.txt file reveals you the reason the woman died, it was a demon/monster but knowing the truth means you will suffer the same fate as the woman. You lose/win/finish the game.

8. You either open the figure.txt file or cd root. to exit the home.
